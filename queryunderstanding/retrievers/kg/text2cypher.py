    Task: Generate an openCypher statement to query a graph database based on the user question.
    Instructions: Based on the graph schema provided, generate a concise and efficient Cypher query.

    Guidelines:
    - Make sure you follow openCypher syntax.
    - Keep queries as simple as possible as the use of keywords is causing issues.
    - Use the provided relationship types and properties from the schema and make sure to follow the correct edge direction.
    - when using ids or labels make sure to treat them as strings with ''.
    - You cannot use aggregates inside aggregates.
    - Try to avoid aggregates if possible.
    - Avoid using collect and similar keywords.
    - Ensure that filtering is done using Ã§WHERE clauses, and avoid using filters inside node patterns.
    - Return only the query, no comments, no explanations, no punctuation of any kind. No '''cypher, no '''
    - Structure the query with MATCH statements to traverse the graph.
    - Only return what is asked. If edges are requested, only return them. If nodes are requested, only return nodes.
    - All sub queries in an UNION must have the same column names.
    - For generic queries like outgoing/incoming edges keep it generic. 
            -outgoing MATCH (n {{id: 'Node'}})-[r]->(m) RETURN distinct type(r)
            -incoming MATCH (m)-[r]->(n {{id: 'Node'}}) RETURN distinct type(r)

    - Keep queries as simple as possible.
    - For creation time, job posts have ctime, freelancers have creation_date
    - ALWAYS use multimatch clauses with intermediate WITH statements instead of paths longer than 2 hops - for example use
            MATCH (c:Category)
            WHERE c.pref_label = 'Graphic Design'
            WITH c
            MATCH (sp:SpecializedProfile)-[:has_category]->(c)
            WITH sp, c
            MATCH (f:Freelancer)-[:has_profile]->(sp)

            instead of 

            MATCH (f:Freelancer)-[:has_profile]->(sp:SpecializedProfile)-[:has_category]->(c:Category)
            WHERE c.pref_label = 'Graphic Design'
            start from the smaller set and try to break every query with more than one steps
                 - i.e. MATCH (a:a)-[r1]->(b:b)-[r2]->(c:c) should be MATCH (a:a)-[r1]->(b:b) WITH a,b MATCH (b)-[r2]->(c:c)
                 - Make sure each match clause only has 2 steps (a)-[b]->(c)
    - Categories are organised into a taxonomy through relationship has_child, has_parent
    - Category taxonomy levels are defined via taxonomy_level property (CATEGORY, SUBCATEGORY, SERVICE)
    - The business jargon for these levels is CATEGORY=L1, SUBCATEGORY=L2, SERVICE=L3 
    - Skills are seeded to categories (L3) through AGs. (Skill)-[belongs_to_ag]->(AG), (AG)<-[related_ag]-(Category) 
    - If a summary of an entity is requested, give a short summary of key points and check 1 hop edges to gather more information.
    - When dealing with dates, use datetime() only for string literals, not variables. c.date>datetime("2020-01-01T00:00:00"). Do not use datetime in other elements like epochMillis.
    - When dealing with duration, i.e. within 5 days, convert date properties to epochMillis(f.date) instead of using  duration.between(datetime(f.date).
    - Avoid using duration() and other date related functions.
    - Avoid using head keyword.
    - Property access over temporal types is not supported.
    - When you want to compare entities to check if they are different (<>), use a property like uid and not the full node. e.g. a.uid <> b.uid instead of a<>b.
    - If you need to do date calculations, today is {today}.
