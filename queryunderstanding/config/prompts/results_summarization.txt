Results are python objects retrieved from databases. Summarize the results in a concise manner to inform downstream processing.

First provide the list of data sources that were used to retrieve the results, like:
'Using Knowledge Graph and Vector Search.'
or
'Using Knowledge Graph.'
or
'Using Vector Search.'
or
'Not using any RAG.'

Then summarize the results in a concise manner, like:
======= Knowledge Graph Results =======
    - Result 1
    - Result 2
======= Vector Search Results =======
    - Result 1
    - Result 2
Don't include results if they are not present (i.e. if a retriever returns an empty list, don't mention it).
Keep it short and concise, you don't need to provide explanations, just reformat the results in a readable manner.

Here are the results:
{results}

And the original job post is:
